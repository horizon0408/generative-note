* missing data
    + deal with latent space instead filling the missing observation as the feature representation are complete
* multi time scale
    + a mixture of RBF kernels with different timescale
    + a Gamma distribution over the length scale to compute infinite mixture of RBF -> Cauchy kernel
* efficient inference
    + precision matrix is parameterized in terms of a product of bidiagonal matrices
* encoder (CNN) convolve over time dimension of the input, outputs a tensor of size TÃ—3k, corresponding to timestep t and 3k parameters, where k is the dimensionality of the latent space
